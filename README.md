SyncNBT
=======

Sync some NBT data between Minecraft servers

## Install
The plugin requires that you have PowerNBT installed, you can download it from this link:
http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/powernbt/

I'm only using the API from PowerNBT so you can disable the rest if you prefer. By default PowerNBT only allows OP:s to use it so it is safe.

You can build it your self with Maven if you prefer, or get the latest snapshot from:

## Found a problem?

If you can, fork and fix it and make a pull request, or just submit a issue here at Github.
