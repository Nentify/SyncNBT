0.3b
  * A heart Canister from Thinkers Construct increases the max health. These items are not moved
    over and we ended up trying to restore 30 health of 20. This caused the import to fail with
    a stacktrace. I added a check to solve this problem.
  * I have also added a lot of try/catch so not the entire import failes.
  * I have added a new database table that trac old reversions of the inventory. No nice interface
    to restore from it (at the moment).
0.3
  * A new "mode 2" based on ProtocolLib, I serializes the itemstacks and store them as JSON.
  * Mode 2 will be set after a "mode 1" import.
  * Various improvements.
  * NOTE: mode 1 is considered deprecated and will be removed in next version.
0.2c
  * Do not store empty tags (solves stacking problems)
0.2b
  * Clear armor slots (prevent dupes)
0.2
  * Check the connection to MySQL before we try to use it
  * Do not clear the inventory before a import (we still clear is after a successful export).
  * Implement FLOAT
  * Experimental implementation of BYTE- and INTARRAY.
  * No more "random enchantments" or "odd named items".
0.1
  * Initial release for testing
